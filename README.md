##Project Description

A password generator based on [this comic](https://xkcd.com/936/) from XKCD. The generator scrapes the table of words from the Connecticut State Community College's list of most commonly misspelled words located [here](http://www.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/misspelled_words.htm) , cleans the data, and then picks a set of words and outputs it as a string separated by -. The number of words and whether the password includes a symbol and/or a number is determined by the user's input; by default the generator picks a four-word password without symbols or numbers.

##Demo
